<p>Hi! I am a physics student at the <a href="https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio">Autonomous University of Madrid</a>.</p>


<p>I enjoy studying the statistical physics of complex systems, i.e., systems made up of many parts where system-wide properties emerge beyond individual components (like the collective movement of a flock of birds). 
    As I continue my academic journey, I am interested in pursuing a PhD in one of the following topics: soft matter, biophysics, computational neuroscience, self-organization, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. </p>
